# gotify Provider

For each application that wants to publish messages to Gotify, you want a new `gotify_application`. Once created, the `token` is populated and can be used to publish messages.

For each client that wants to read messages from Gotify, you want a new `gotify_client`. Once created, the `token` is populated and can be used to fetch messages.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Required configuration
provider "gotify" {
  endpoint = "http://my.gotify.local" # or GOTIFY_ENDPOINT
  username = "admin"                  # or GOTIFY_USERNAME
  password = "admin"                  # or GOTIFY_PASSWORD
}

# When Gotify is behind a reverse proxy and DNS isn't setup yet
provider "gotify" {
  endpoint    = "http://192.168.1.4" # public, static IP of deployment
  host_header = "my.gotify.local"    # Host header expected by reverse proxy
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `endpoint` (String) Endpoint with Protocol to send requests to.
- `host_header` (String) This is useful when Gotify is deployed behind a reverse proxy and this provider is used in your infrastructure setup where DNS might not be available yet. You can then set the endpoint to an IP address and the Host to what your reverse Proxy expects.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The Password to authenticate against the server. Gotify's default "admin" user has "admin" as their password.
- `username` (String) The Username to authenticate against the server. Gotify has a default "admin" user
