The plugin must already be on the server. It must be compatible as well, you can check this manually by navigating to "Plugins" in the Web interface.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gotify_plugin" "example" {
  module_path = "github.com/LukasKnuth/gotify-slack-webhook"
  enabled     = true
}

# NOTE: As stated in the field description, you need to set host/port and plugin prefix yourself.

  sensitive = true
  value     = "https://gotify.local${gotify_plugin.example.webhook_path}/slack_webhook"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `enabled` (Boolean) Sets the desired plugin status.
- `module_path` (String) The unique identifier of this plugin, chosen by the author. Check "Plugins" in the Web interface to find this out manually.

### Optional

- `webhook_path` (String, Sensitive) You are responsible for setting the host/port AND the sub-path the plugin sets itself. Usually, the plugin description has more information, check "Plugins" in the Web interface.

For example, if the full plugin webhook path is `https://localhost:8080/plugin/1/custom/t0k3n/slack_message` then this field will contain `/plugin/1/custom/t0k3n`

NOTE: The path **does** include a leading slash but **not** a trailing slash.

### Read-Only

- `token` (String, Sensitive) The token generated for this plugin. Mainly used for Webhooks.
